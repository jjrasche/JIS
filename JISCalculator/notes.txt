request:
    build a calculator using .NET 4.5, ASP.NET MVC 5 and C#, 
    use whatever front end technologies beyond that to make it a good user experience. 
    Build it to the quality of something to be delivered to a customer.
    Also, spedn no more than 4 hours on it, it does not need to be a finished product. 
    Submit solution and all code files to us via GitHub and we can go from there.


project setup:
- vs 2017 new project angular
- npm install 
- webpack --config webpack.config.vendor.js


functionality:
    interface responds to both keyboard input and GUI numberpad
    the following math functions of (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division)
    the following inputs are allowed via GUI 
        numbers 0 - 9
        x for multiply
        / for divide
        + for add
        - for subtract
        = for submit
        ce for clear solution
    the following inputs are allowed via keyboard
        numbers 0 - 9
        x for multiply
        / for divide
        + for add
        - for subtract
    all calulations are done server side
    all values are handled as decimals for max precision 
    rules for valid input
        no consecutive operations                           "1++2"
        value must be less than  decimal MAX                "79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,336-5"
        no more than 1 decimal points in a given value      "1.115.-1.3"
    logic to parse string input into operations
        1. remove all whitespace
        2. split calculations by operations
        3. form operation objects e.g. {value: 15.5, opType: SUBTRACTION}        
        4. starting with value of 0 iterate over operations maintaining current calculaiton value

test cases
    happy path
    all valid input tests
